#### _**CONCEPT**_

The idea is to incorporate everything about Air Hockey into a browser-based game.

Using **divs** and assigning them different **Classes**, **IDs** and **CSS Flexbox** we can construct a facsimile Ice Rink, Sticks, a puck, two Goals, and even blue and red lines. and get several divs to move within one another and recognize boundary.

#### _**STICKS**_ 

To make the sticks (player1 and player2 respectively) I plan to use divs and use the Keyboard Arrows to manipulate their controls.

We'll use contact based velocity to emulate a stick directing the puck towards the goal (otherwise known as a _**shot**_).

**Sticks** are _unbelieveable_.

### _**Technologies**_

Here is where we talk about the technologies we're using on this project. 

Luckily you only know HTML, CSS and JavaScript so that's what we're gonna say here.

### _**Getting Started**_

To begin select the FACE OFF Button which will start a timer of 3 seconds.

The game will initialize and Player1 (The Red Stick)'s controller will become active and can be used via the Keyboard Arrows.

The puck will move upon contact and bounce of the parameters of the grid I build out of Divs to emulate boards.

The game will run for a facsimile period elapsing when one player **scores 5 goals**. Aka first to 5 goals = winner, winner chicken dinner...

Then, a **message** will display declaring the winner and a PLAY AGAIN button will appear allowing the USER/PLAYER to reset the score and PLAY AGAIN using the FACE OFF Button when ready.

### **WIREFRAME**
To effectively build this we'll be utilizing DIVS and SPANS to create shapes and the assigning them Classes and IDs to assign them different property values.

Then, using gap we'll make sure they can't contact one another without invoking a reaction.
