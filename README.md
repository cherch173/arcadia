#### _**CONCEPT**_

The idea is to incorporate everything about Air Hockey into a browser-based game.

Using **divs**, **classes**, **IDs** and **CSS Flexbox** we can construct a facsimile Ice Rink, Sticks, a puck, two Goals, and even blue and red lines.

Every game needs a theme though (to help it stand out) and so I thought I would draw inspiration from Seasons 2 and 3 of Letterkenny and feature a few cast members as playable characters.


#### _**STICKS**_ 

To make the sticks (player1 and player2 respectively) I plan to use divs and use the Keyboard Arrows to manipulate their controls.

We'll use contact based velocity to emulate a stick directing the puck towards the goal (otherwise known as a _**shot**_).

**Sticks** are _unbelieveable_.

Here is where we talk about the technologies we're using on this project. 

Luckily you only know HTML, CSS and JavaScript so that's what we're gonna say here.

To begin the project: I'll start by using a general grey background and begin constructing the Ice Rink (aka the Board) as Divs to ensure functionality before aesthetics.

Then, I'll get fancy.

Then we play hockey.

### **WIREFRAME**
this is where we put the wireframe to pitch the layout

There's gonna be text.

There's gonna be an [Image] of the WIREFRAME.

Then there's gonna be more text.
